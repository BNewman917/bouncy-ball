<h2>Bouncy Ball</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This is a project done for the MIT xPro Coding Cootcamp.
<h3>Description</h3>
This is a ball bouncing around the screen. On impact with screen edges, it changes to a random size and color.
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
I plan to add interactivity to create new balls on mouse-click.
